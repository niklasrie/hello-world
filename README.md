Checking out the tutorial situation

Hallo programmers and wanna-be's of this world,

I most definitely identify as the latter, but in due time will hopefully evolve into the former! 
Coming from a humanitarian/development background, I am eager to explore the potential of programming to create a better world (normatively vague, I know, but let's keep it like that for now. Get in touch if you want to go into what that entails to me.) 

In case you've got anything to share with respect to this, please do let me know! 

Cheers

NR
